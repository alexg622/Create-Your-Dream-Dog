This is an ongoing project that allows you to create your dream dog. All dream dogs are displayed on the home page in the order by which dogs have the most likes. To create a dream dog a user must create an account and login. Logged in users can also like, dislike, and comment on other user's dogs. They can only like or dislike a dog once. Only the user who created a dog can update or delete that dog, as well as update or delete their own profile. This project is ongoing, as I plan to use materialize to style the app. I also plan to use an API that will bring in pictures of dogs for users to choose from and use as avatars for the dogs that they want to create.
