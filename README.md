This project allows you to create your dream dog. All dream dogs are displayed on the home page in the order by which dogs have the most likes. To create a dream dog a user must create an account and login. Logged in users can also like, dislike, and comment on other user's dogs. They can only like or dislike a dog once. Only the user who created a comment, or the dogs owner of that comment can delete the comment. Only the user who created a dog can update or delete that dog, as well as update or delete their own profile. I used Materialize to style this project.
